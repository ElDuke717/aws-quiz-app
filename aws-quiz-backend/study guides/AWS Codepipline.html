# AWS CodePipeline Study Guide

## Key Concepts and Definitions

- **AWS CodePipeline**: A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. It automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process.
- **Pipeline**: A workflow that defines how software changes should progress through your release process.
- **Stage**: A logical unit in a pipeline where actions such as build, test, and deploy are performed.
- **Action**: A task performed in a stage, such as source, build, test, or deploy.
- **Artifact**: The output of an action, which can be input for a subsequent action.
- **Source Action**: The first action in a pipeline, which retrieves the source code from a specified location like AWS S3, GitHub, or AWS CodeCommit.
- **Build Action**: Compiles the source code into an executable form and runs tests.
- **Deploy Action**: Deploys the artifacts to environments such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS ECS, or AWS Lambda.

## Comparison Table

| Feature        | AWS CodePipeline                        | Jenkins                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Service Type   | Managed CI/CD service                   | Self-hosted CI/CD tool               |
| Integration    | Seamless integration with AWS services  | Requires plugins for AWS integration |
| Cost           | Pay-per-use model                       | Free (but requires infrastructure)   |
| Scalability    | Automatically scales with demand        | Requires manual scaling              |
| Setup          | Quick setup with AWS console            | Requires server setup and maintenance|

## Outline of Processes

1. **Create a Pipeline**:
   - Define the pipeline structure by specifying stages and actions.
   - Configure source action to fetch code.
   - Add build action to compile and test code.
   - Define deploy action to release code to environments.

2. **Configure Stages**:
   - **Source Stage**: Connect to a version control system.
   - **Build Stage**: Use AWS CodeBuild or third-party services.
   - **Deploy Stage**: Deploy using AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda.

3. **Trigger Pipeline Execution**:
   - Manual trigger via AWS Management Console.
   - Automatic trigger based on code changes or schedule.

4. **Monitor and Manage**:
   - Use AWS Management Console to monitor pipeline status.
   - Review logs and metrics for troubleshooting.

## Practice Questions

1. **What is the primary purpose of AWS CodePipeline?**
   - A) To host applications
   - B) To automate the build, test, and deploy phases
   - C) To manage AWS IAM roles
   - D) To create virtual networks

   **Answer**: B

2. **Which AWS service is commonly used for the build stage in AWS CodePipeline?**
   - A) AWS Lambda
   - B) AWS CodeBuild
   - C) AWS CodeDeploy
   - D) Amazon S3

   **Answer**: B

3. **What is an artifact in AWS CodePipeline?**
   - A) A stage in the pipeline
   - B) A task performed in a stage
   - C) The output of an action
   - D) A trigger for pipeline execution

   **Answer**: C

4. **How can you trigger an AWS CodePipeline execution?**
   - A) Only manually via AWS CLI
   - B) Automatically based on events or schedule
   - C) Only on a fixed schedule
   - D) Only upon user request

   **Answer**: B

5. **Which of the following is a deploy action destination in AWS CodePipeline?**
   - A) AWS Elastic Beanstalk
   - B) Amazon S3
   - C) AWS IAM
   - D) AWS CloudWatch

   **Answer**: A

## Potential Points of Confusion

- **Artifacts vs. Actions**: Artifacts are the outputs of actions, not the actions themselves.
- **Managed vs. Self-hosted**: AWS CodePipeline is managed by AWS, reducing infrastructure maintenance needs compared to tools like Jenkins.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Understanding the integration between CodePipeline and other AWS services is crucial for effective pipeline setup.
