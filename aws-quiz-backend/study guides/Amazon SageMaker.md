# AWS Amazon SageMaker Study Guide

## Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Amazon SageMaker**: A fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly.
- **Notebook Instances**: Managed Jupyter notebooks that make it easy to explore and visualize data.
- **Training**: The process of providing a machine learning model with data to learn from.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automates the process of searching for the best hyperparameter values for your training jobs.
- **Hosting Services**: Deploy trained models for inference at scale.
- **Inference**: The process of generating predictions from a machine learning model.
- **Batch Transform**: A feature that allows you to run predictions on large datasets in batch mode.
- **Ground Truth**: A data labeling service that makes it easy to create highly accurate training datasets.

## Mnemonics and Memory Aids

- **SAGE**: Remember the core components of SageMaker with the mnemonic "SAGE":
  - **S**etup (Notebook Instances)
  - **A**nalyze (Training and Hyperparameter Tuning)
  - **G**enerate (Inference and Batch Transform)
  - **E**valuate (Model Deployment and Monitoring)

## Process Outline

### Model Training and Deployment

1. **Prepare Data**: Use Amazon S3 to store your dataset.
2. **Build a Model**: Use SageMaker's built-in algorithms or bring your own.
3. **Train the Model**: Launch training jobs with your data and model scripts.
4. **Tune Hyperparameters**: Optimize model performance using automated tuning.
5. **Deploy the Model**: Use hosting services for real-time or batch inference.
6. **Monitor and Update**: Continuously monitor model performance and update as needed.

## Potential Points of Confusion

- **Notebook Instances vs. Training Jobs**: Notebook Instances are used for data exploration and model development, whereas Training Jobs are for model training.
- **Real-time Inference vs. Batch Transform**: Real-time inference is used for immediate predictions, while Batch Transform handles large-scale batch predictions.
- **Built-in Algorithms vs. Custom Scripts**: SageMaker offers built-in algorithms for common tasks, but you can also use custom scripts for specialized needs.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning vs. Model Training**: Tuning is a separate process from training, focused on optimizing model performance by adjusting hyperparameters.
