Get 24/7 support from our DDoS response team and detailed visibility into DDoS events.\n\nWe’ll now go into more detail on each service.\n\n## AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)\n\nAWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.\n\nAWS WAF helps protect web applications from attacks by allowing you to configure rules that allow, block, or monitor (count) web requests based on conditions that you define.\n\nThese conditions include IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, URI strings, SQL injection and cross-site scripting.\n\nCan allow or block web requests based on strings that appear in the requests using string match conditions.\n\nFor example, AWS WAF can match values in the following request parts:\n\n- Header – A specified request header, for example, the User-Agent or Referer header.\n- HTTP method – The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, and PUT.\n- Query string – The part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\n- URI – The URI path of the request, which identifies the resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg.\n- Body – The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.\n- Single query parameter (value only) – Any parameter that you have defined as part of the query string.\n- All query parameters (values only) – As above buy inspects all parameters within the query string.\n\nNew rules can be deployed within minutes, letting you respond quickly to changing traffic patterns.\n\nWhen AWS services receive requests for web sites, the requests are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection against defined rules.\n\nOnce a request meets a condition defined in the rules, AWS WAF instructs the underlying service to either block or allow the request based on the action you define.\n\nWith AWS WAF you pay only for what you use.\n\nAWS WAF pricing is based on how many rules you deploy and how many web requests your web application receives.\n\nThere are no upfront commitments.\n\nAWS WAF is tightly integrated with Amazon CloudFront and the Application Load Balancer (ALB), services.\n\nWhen you use AWS WAF on Amazon CloudFront, rules run in all AWS Edge Locations, located around the world close to end users.\n\nThis means security doesn’t come at the expense of performance.\n\nBlocked requests are stopped before they reach your web servers.\n\nWhen you use AWS WAF on an Application Load Balancer, your rules run in region and can be used to protect internet-facing as well as internal load balancers.\n\n### Web Traffic Filtering\n\nAWS WAF lets you create rules to filter web traffic based on conditions that include IP addresses, HTTP headers and body, or custom URIs.\n\nThis gives you an additional layer of protection from web attacks that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in custom or third-party web applications.\n\nIn addition, AWS WAF makes it easy to create rules that block common web exploits like SQL injection and cross site scripting.\n\nAWS WAF allows you to create a centralized set of rules that you can deploy across multiple websites.\n\nThis means that in an environment with many websites and web applications you can create a single set of rules that you can reuse across applications rather than recreating that rule on every application you want to protect.\n\n### Full feature API\n\nAWS WAF can be completely administered via APIs.\n\nThis provides organizations with the ability to create and maintain rules automatically and incorporate them into the development and design process.\n\nFor example, a developer who has detailed knowledge of the web application could create a security rule as part of the deployment process.\n\nThis capability to incorporate security into your development process avoids the need for complex handoffs between application and security teams to make sure rules are kept up to date.\n\nAWS WAF can also be deployed and provisioned automatically with AWS CloudFormation sample templates that allow you to describe all security rules you would like to deploy for your web applications delivered by Amazon CloudFront.\n\nAWS WAF is integrated with Amazon CloudFront, which supports custom origins outside of AWS – this means you can protect web sites not hosted in AWS.\n\nSupport for IPv6 allows the AWS WAF to inspect HTTP/S requests coming from both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.\n\n### Real-time visibility\n\nAWS WAF provides real-time metrics and captures raw requests that include details about IP addresses, geo locations, URIs, User-Agent and Referers.\n\nAWS WAF is fully integrated with Amazon CloudWatch, making it easy to setup custom alarms when thresholds are exceeded, or attacks occur.\n\nThis information provides valuable intelligence that can be used to create new rules to better protect applications.\n\n## AWS Shield\n\nAWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS.\n\nAWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection.\n\nThere are two tiers of AWS Shield – Standard and Advanced.\n\n### AWS Shield Standard\n\nAll AWS customers benefit from the automatic protections of AWS Shield Standard, at no additional charge.\n\nAWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target web sites or applications.\n\nWhen using AWS Shield Standard with Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53, you receive comprehensive availability protection against all known infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) attacks.\n\n### AWS Shield Advanced\n\nProvides higher levels of protection against attacks targeting applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon Route 53 resources.\n\nIn addition to the network and transport layer protections that come with Standard, AWS Shield Advanced provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility into attacks, and integration with AWS WAF, a web application firewall.\n\nAWS Shield Advanced also gives you 24×7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and protection against DDoS related spikes in your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon Route 53 charges.\n\nAWS Shield Advanced is available globally on all Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 edge locations.\n\nOrigin servers can be Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), or a custom server outside of AWS.\n\nAWS Shield Advanced includes DDoS cost protection, a safeguard from scaling charges because of a DDoS attack that causes usage spikes on protected Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, or Amazon Route 53.\n\nIf any of the AWS Shield Advanced protected resources scale up in response to a DDoS attack, you can request credits via the regular AWS Support channel.",
